Our old [wiki](http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com/) is showing its years...
in addition to loading rather slow, it has some
obnoxious ads. So, [Steven](http://clontz.org)
whipped up this updated **Auburn Puzzle Party** site to replace it.
It's being tracked on
[GitHub](https://github.com/StevenClontz/auburn-puzzle-party) where
anyone can edit it directly. If you want to become a maintainer, email Steven
at <steven.clontz@gmail.com>.
