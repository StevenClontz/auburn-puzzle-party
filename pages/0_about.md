Do you enjoy a good puzzle? So do we! We're a community of puzzle creators
and solvers in Auburn, AL (and others who travel to join us) who plan and
play regular puzzle parties and puzzle hunts, and this is our wiki.
We've been called **The Best Kept Secret in Puzzling**, so you should
definitely join us at our next event!

The goal of this site is to provide a central location to see information
about all Auburn community puzzle events: past, present, and future.
We hope to expand upon Eric Harshbarger's [EPP][EPP] page to also include
Auburn Puzzle Party competitions and other events and puzzles of note.
