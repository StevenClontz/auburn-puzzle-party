Hey there's a few ways you can help us out.

## Website Updates

Our website is hosted on [Github][github]. If there's interest we'll
write up a more detailed description on how you can edit/update the site,
but for now we'll say this: you just need a web browser, and if you're
interested email [Steven][steven email] to get started.

[github]: https://github.com/StevenClontz/auburn-puzzle-party
[steven email]: mailto:steven.clontz@gmail.com

We're still in the process of porting over old articles from the
[community wiki][wiki], so there's a great way you could help.

## Announcements

Do you know of any cool puzzle events around east Alabama,
or other topics of interest for the Auburn puzzle community? We have a
blog on this site, and we also have an email newsletter. We try to use
the newsletter sparingly, but you can immediately make your announcement on
the website. You can ping [Steven][steven email] to get
in on either loop.

## Organize an Event!!

Oh my, how did we list this last? The best way you can contribute to the
community is by running an event! Potlucks are by far the easiest events to
run, but if you've got some puzzles looking for an audience, we can always
use more puzzlehunt organizers as well. If you don't know how to get started,
you can always [ask around][steven email] and any community member would
be glad to help.
